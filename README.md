# Resourcery
A framework prototype

## Introduction
I was tired of creating UI with XML and the standard WoW API so I created this as a test to feel around a bit.  
With Resourcery you can create Lua templates, more or less the same as the XML templates.  
  
As this is a prototype, not all frame types are supported (yet).  
  
**Supported frame types currently are:**  
- Frame
- Texture
- Button
- FontString  
  
**Other features are:**  
* Lua templates
* Duplicate
* Macros
* Scripts
* AIO usage
